## What it does

You say:

> Create an illustration for API version management.

You get a concept, a metaphor, and a production-ready SVG that looks like it
belongs to everything else you've made.

These aren't marketing illustrations. They're abstractions of an **interface** —
what a feature looks like if you keep its most recognisable parts and throw away
the other 90%.

> **Abstract the interface, not the idea.**

A good one makes someone think *"I understand what this feature does."* Never
*"that's a screenshot of the product."*

## Install

**Claude Code**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Devesh-Shirsath/spotkit.git \
  ~/.claude/skills/spotkit
```

Restart Claude Code and just ask. The skill picks itself up whenever you mention
feature illustrations, spot illustrations, empty states, or an illustration set
for a product.

**Codex**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Devesh-Shirsath/spotkit.git \
  ~/.agents/skills/spotkit
```

Restart Codex, then ask — or call it by name: `$spotkit an illustration for audit logs`.

**Any other agent** — clone the repo into your project and ask it to follow
`SKILL.md`. `AGENTS.md` tells it what to read and what to skip.

**Claude.ai** — Settings → Capabilities → Skills → upload a zip of this repo.
Re-upload it whenever the repo changes; an old upload keeps the old rules.

**ChatGPT, or any chat tool** — make a Project (or a custom GPT), upload
`SPEC.md`, `references/icons.md` and `references/examples.md` to it, and paste
the standing instructions below into its instructions. Uploaded files beat
links: a chat tool may skim a link, or not open it at all.

### Standing instructions

The same rules for every tool, so they all draw the same family:

```text
You make Spotkit illustrations: minimal, abstract SVG product illustrations
that follow SPEC.md exactly.

1. Write SVG code by hand. Never use image generation.
2. Adapt, don't invent. Pick the nearest of the twelve layouts in SPEC.md §7,
   start from its example file, keep its geometry (panel, backdrop, float,
   card sizes and positions) and change only the content: the icon, what sits
   inside the cards, how many rows. Invent a new composition only if none of
   the twelve fits, and say so.
3. Never improvise a value. Every number, colour and snippet comes from
   SPEC.md: one stroke width (0.5), one stroke colour (var(--il-line)), one
   shadow, the fade mask, var(--il-*) colours.
4. Centred on x=80 and square. Few, large elements: nothing that carries
   meaning is smaller than 9 units.
5. Icons are filled Phosphor paths from icons.md. Never draw or stroke a glyph.
6. Before answering, go through SPEC.md §9 and fix whatever fails.

Reply with: feature interpretation, metaphor, which layout it adapts,
primitives, then the SVG.
```

**No dependencies.** Python 3 only — to regenerate, or to run `check.py`.

## Try it without installing

Open [`examples/gallery.html`](examples/gallery.html) in a browser — twelve
illustrations, light and dark, from the same twelve files.

## Why SVG and not an image model

This style is pure geometry: hairline strokes, exact radii, repeated placeholder
bars, one icon family. Diffusion models are weak at all of it, and weakest at the
thing that matters most — **twenty illustrations that look like one family.**

The model writes the SVG directly instead. The output is exact, themeable, editable,
diffable, and identical in treatment across a whole set. A prompt-based fallback
is included if you want it anyway.

## How it works

```
your feature description
      ↓
what does it actually do?
      ↓
what relationship is it about?      grouping · connecting · gating
      ↓                             packaging · reviewing · sequencing
2–5 UI primitives that carry it
      ↓
a layout — chosen from the prompt, not from habit
      ↓
SVG, themed by CSS custom properties
      ↓
a quality checklist
```

### Twelve layouts

Picked by **meaning** and by how many elements the idea needs — never by rotation.

| Layout | Reads as |
|---|---|
| Header + rows | many of one thing |
| Cascade | a group, receding |
| Tab bar | one option chosen from several |
| Toolbar | tools and the people using them |
| Corner chips | a thing with parts attached |
| Window | a real surface, more off-screen |
| Fanned | a set with one chosen |
| Notifications | events arriving |
| Constellation | systems converging |
| Matrix | who can do what |
| Timeline | sequence, newest first |
| Split | moving through stages |

They come from independent choices — where the floating element sits, what it is,
how content is arranged, how the panel is framed — so the real space is much
larger than twelve.

**Monotony is the failure mode of this style.** A set where every piece is
"header card, then rows" reads as one image twelve times, however clean each one
is. The skill budgets layout reuse, caps full-width headers at two per twelve,
and checks each illustration against its neighbours.

## Theming

Twelve CSS custom properties. **One file serves light and dark** — never ship two.

```css
:root {
  --il-canvas:  #EDEAE6;   --il-ghost:   #EAE7E2;   --il-panel: #F7F5F2;
  --il-surface: #FFFFFF;   --il-line:    #B9B1A4;   /* every stroke, width 0.5 */
  --il-stroke:  #35322D;   --il-fill:    #DCD6CE;   --il-accent: #3E9077;
}
```

Change three values, rerun `build.py`, the whole set rethemes.

> **Inline the SVG to theme it.** CSS custom properties don't cross into
> `<img src="…">` or `<object>` — those show the fallback palette forever and
> never follow dark mode. If you must use `<img>`, use the pre-flattened files in
> [`examples/flat/`](examples/flat).

If several illustrations share a page, suffix every `id` in each
(`fade-teams` → `fade-teams-1`) or their masks and filters cross-apply.

## Using these in Figma

Copy the contents of any file in [`examples/flat/light/`](examples/flat/light)
and paste onto a Figma canvas — you get editable vector layers. Use the flat
files, not the themed ones; Figma doesn't run CSS either, so a themed file pastes
as black shapes.

Figma discards SVG filters on import, so the drop shadow won't come across —
re-apply it as a Figma effect on the one floating layer.

## Check an illustration

```bash
python3 check.py my-feature.svg
```

Catches the defects that fail silently: a second stroke width or colour, more
than one shadow, a background rect, text, unsuffixed ids, a moved fade line.
Works on output from any model.

## Regenerate

```bash
python3 build.py         # rewrites examples/, the gallery and references/icons.md
python3 flatten.py       # rewrites the flat exports and contact sheets
python3 check.py --docs  # fails if any doc disagrees with build.py
```

Every constant lives in the `GEO` dict at the top of `build.py`. Change one and
all twelve move together — which is the operation you'll want most, and the one
that's most error-prone by hand.

## Known limitations

Worth stating rather than having you discover:

- **The metaphor test isn't enforced.** The checklist says *cover the icon — can
  a stranger still describe the relationship?* Nothing forces a run to apply it.
  In testing, two prompts in ten produced illustrations that lean on their icon
  to be legible.
- **One style preset.** The dial system — elevation, edge treatment, overhang,
  corner language, stroke weight, icon style, palette, density — is documented,
  but only one combination ships. A second is additive; nothing in the method
  changes.
- **The 0.5 stroke has a floor.** Below roughly 96px display width it drops under
  half a device pixel and antialiases away. At those sizes, drop the hairlines
  and let fills carry the composition.
- **Figma import loses shadows.** See above.

## Who it's for

Product and UX designers, frontend developers, SaaS founders, design system and
docs teams — anyone who needs feature illustrations, empty-state graphics or a
coherent illustration family for a whole product, and doesn't want to draw twenty
of them by hand.

## Credits

Icons are [Phosphor](https://phosphoricons.com) (MIT), regular weight — filled
paths on a 256 grid, so `fill` them rather than stroking.

The shipped style was derived by measuring a real production illustration family,
rebuilding it from first principles, and verifying by rendering and comparison.
Aesthetic direction was informed by contemporary bento-grid layouts. Your own
direction can differ on every visual dial — the method is what transfers.
